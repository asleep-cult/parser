compiled or interpreted?

The "official" implementation will use a JIT compiler.

basic syntax?

The idea is named blocks of code that can be decorated with block decorators

```
function namedBlock(int x) void {
        Integer foo = 9;
}
```

here function is the block decorator

```
struct NamedBlock {
        Integer foo;
}
```

here struct is the block decorator

```
private class NamedBlock {
}
```

here there a multiple block decorators... private and class.
These aren't keywords... just built-in decorators :^)
