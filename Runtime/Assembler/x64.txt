Windows calling convention:

rdi, /* Used to store the first argument in function call */
rsi, /* Used to store the second argument in function call */

/* RAX, RCX, RDX, R8, R9, R10, and R11 are volatile */
/* RBX, RBP, RDI, RSI, R12, R14, R14, and R15 must be saved */

/* Must be allocated by the caller */
rdx, /* Used to store the third integer or pointer argument in
function call */
rcx,  /* Used to store the forth integer or pointer argument in
function call */
r8,  /* Used to store the fifth integer or pointer argument in
function call */
r9, /* Used to store the sixth integer or pointer argument in
function call*/

xmmo0, /* Used to store the first floating point argument in function
call, used for floating point return values as well */
xmmo1, /* Used to store the second floating point argument in function
call */
xmmo1, /* Used to store the thrid floating point argument in function
call */

/* Additional arguments are pushed onto stack */

rax, /* Used for function return values if the value is 64 bits or
less - otherwise space is allocated on the stack by the caller
and a pointer to the allocated memory is in rcx and moved to rax?, this
means integer parameters will be offset by one */

rbx, /* Anything but must save? */
rbp, /* Points to the base of the current stack frame so changes can be
made to rsp without affecting the offset of local variables */
rsp, /* Points to the top of the stack */

r10, /* Temporary - do whatever you want */
r11, /* Temporary - do whatever you want */
r12, /* Anything but must save? */
r13, /* Anything but must save? */
r14, /* Anything but must save? */
r15 /* Anything but must save? */
